## Instagram Clone

### About this project
Instagram Clone is an Instagram-like application created to demonstrate my skills in developing a full-stack web application using the MERN stack. It implements a social networking system with several features, such as:
- Authentication system: handles user authentication and authorization.
- Middlewares: manage specific criteria and logic for each back-end route, such as validation, authentication and image upload.
- Redux: used with services and slices to properly manage and handle API call states.
- MongoDB Atlas: used to store all user and post data in a cloud-based NoSQL database.
- Local storage: used to store all profile and post images.

### Observations
This project was developed to demonstrate my skills in building a full-stack social media application inspired by Instagram. It focuses on implementing the core features rather than replicating every functionality of the original app.
