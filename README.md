### Instagram Clone

### About this project
Instagram Clone is an Instagram-like application created to demonstrate my skills in developing a full-stack web application using the MERN stack. It implements a social networking system with several features, such as:
- Authentication system: handles user authentication and authorization.
- Middlewares: manage specific criteria and logic for each back-end route, such as validation, authentication and image upload.
- Redux: used with services and slices to properly manage and handle API call states.
- MongoDB: used to store all user and post data in a cloud-based NoSQL database.
- Local storage: used to store all profile and post images.

### Observations
This project was developed to demonstrate my skills in building a full-stack social media application inspired by Instagram. It focuses on implementing the core features rather than replicating every functionality of the original app.

### Functionalities
- Sign in, sign up and sign out user.

- Update user profile data, such as: User name and profile photo.

### Getting Started
To run this application in development mode, you'll need to create an account on OpenWeatherMap and obtain an API Key. Once you obtain this key, you simply need to paste it into the project's "API_KEY" constant.
